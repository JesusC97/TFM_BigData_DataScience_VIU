Want to create a consistent look,brand and social media presence across Facebook and LinkedIn. We currently have 4-5 main categories which are: events,cohort companies milestones,webinars,site visits,general.
We aim to keep the audience informed about who we are,what we do and how we can help other startups. We mainly use posts and events.
We need a designer to help develop a brand and create templates for us to use for invitations and online posts to promote Unlock Capital. We already have a logo,colors and fonts,as we have an agency that works with our parent company CDVCA.
